# BeTheNation Codebase Improvements

## 1. Centralized Demo Mode

- Created a dedicated `DemoModeContext` to centralize demo mode state and logic
- Separated demo mode types into `types/demo.ts` for better organization
- Implemented a more structured demo store with enhanced error handling
- Added React Context provider to make demo mode accessible throughout the app

## 2. Simplified Contract Integration

- Created a `ContractService` class to encapsulate contract interaction logic
- Implemented standard methods for common operations (openPosition, closePosition, setTPSL)
- Improved error handling and validation for contract operations
- Reduced duplication across the codebase

## 3. Modularized Large Files

- Split the large `sidebar.tsx` (764 lines) into modular components:
  - `sidebar/context.tsx` - Context provider and state management
  - `sidebar/base.tsx` - Base sidebar components
  - `sidebar/index.tsx` - Exports and additional components
- Improved maintainability and readability

## 4. Enhanced Error Handling

- Created a standardized error handling system in `lib/error-handler.ts`
- Categorized errors by type (network, contract, validation, wallet)
- Added specialized error formatters and handlers
- Consistent toast notifications for errors across the application

## 5. Improved Hook Organization

- Enhanced `usePositions` hook to work seamlessly with both demo and real positions
- Added more functionality to handle both demo and real trading in a single interface
- Better separation of concerns by leveraging the demo mode context

## 6. Code Organization

- Removed redundant files and duplicate functions
- Standardized import paths and naming conventions
- Created clearer component hierarchies
- Improved type definitions and interfaces

## Next Steps

- Consider adding automated tests for critical functionality
- Implement performance optimizations for large state management
- Create documentation for the application architecture
- Consider type-generation for smart contract interactions
